## Getting Started

You can install this rice right after Arch Linux installation

**Important**:

- The install script is only tested on my machine, use it at your own risk (install dotfiles and packages only unless you know what you're doing)
- If the script is not doing everything automatically (except enter your password), there is a bug, please open an issue
- Capslock is now Ctrl when held and Esc when tapped
- Left Alt and Left Super is swapped
- Multi monitor is not working properly yet, please open a PR if you have a solution

### Prerequisites

The install script below assumes you installed Arch with [my instruction](https://github.com/khuedoan98/archguide). You can also install these dotfiles manually

You will need at least these packages for this rice to be usable (use the install script bellow for automatic installation):

Base:
`xorg-server`
`xorg-xinit`
`bspwm`
`sxhkd`
[`dmenu`](https://github.com/khuedoan98/dmenu)
[`polybar`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/polybar/)
[`st`](https://github.com/khuedoan98/st)

Fonts:
[`nerd-fonts-source-code-pro`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nerd-fonts-source-code-pro/)
[`ttf-mac-fonts`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-mac-fonts/)

Optional:
[`compton-tryone-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/compton-tryone-git/)
[`slock`](https://github.com/khuedoan98/slock)

### Installation

Notes:

- Using the method below, you can update new features from my repo using `dotfiles pull`, but you can't push your own customization to GitHub
- If you want to push your customization to GitHub (please read the next section for version control instruction), you need to fork this repo, change the `REPO` variable in `install.sh`, then continue running the script with the instruction below. You can't update new features automatically with `dotfiles pull`, but you can [do that manually](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)
- If you want to start fresh, check out my [Arch install script](https://github.com/khuedoan98/archguide/blob/master/install.sh) which will also install this rice
- If anyone has a better solution, please create a PR or issue, and any other improvement is welcome

Download the install script:

`curl -O https://khuedoan.me/dotfiles/install.sh`

`chmod +x install.sh`

For advanced features, use CLI:

To download just the minimum for `zsh`, `neovim`, and `tmux`

`./install.sh --minimal`

To run selected features, add the feature's flag in the table above, for example:

`./install.sh --dotfiles --packages --extra-packages`

To install everything (don't use this if you don't know what it actually does, read the script first):

`./install.sh --all`

### Usage

#### Quick start

Remember the key changes, you can change this in `.xinitrc`:

- Capslock is now Ctrl when held and Esc when tapped
- Left Alt and Left Super is swapped

`super + /`         for help

`super + enter`     for terminal

`super + space`     for app launcher

`super + shift + q` to quit app

#### Version control

Not available in minimal installation.
You can update by running `./install.sh --minimal` again.

The following `dotfiles` command is an alias to [manage dotfiles using git bare](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797)

Make change to the dotfiles to suit your needs, then use `dotfiles` command instead of `git` for version control

For example:

`dotfiles add .config/foo`

`dotfiles commit`

`dotfiles push`

`dotfiles pull`
